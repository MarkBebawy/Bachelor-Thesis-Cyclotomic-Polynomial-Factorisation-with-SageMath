However, as the linear coefficient is one (monic polynomials), this means that one constant coefficient must be zero, but then $\\Phi_p(X) = X g(X)$ for some polynomial $g \\in \\FF_q[X]$, but the product $X g(X)$ has no constant term, whereas $\\Phi_p(X) = 1 + X + \\ldots + X^{p - 1}$.

    "- _For strength = ord - sparsity:_\n",
    "    - why does it sometimes happen that $\\ord_p(q) = (p - 1)/3$ gives a stronger counterexample, while $\\ord_p(q) = (p - 1)/2$ also holds for some other field $\\FF_q$?\n",
    "        - Maybe $\\ord_p(q) = (p - 1)/2$ is only strongest, when $q$ is small? In other words, maybe the strongest counterexamples emerge for the smallest $q$ that has `high' order in $\\FF_p^\\ast$. This can be experimented by analysing the ratio $\\ord_p(q)/q$.\n",
    "    - Why do the primes $p = 13, 211$ have weird behaviour when factoring over fields $\\FF_q$ with $\\ord_p(q) = (p - 1)/2$?\n",
    "        - why does $p = 13$ and $q = 17$ (such that $\\ord_p(q) = (p - 1)/2 = 6$) give no counterexamples?\n",
    "            - does $p = 13$ have other counterexamples over $\\FF_q$ with $\\ord_p(q) = (p - 1)/2 = 6$?\n",
    "            - how does the strength of the counterexamples for $p = 13$ behave?\n",
    "        - For $p = 211$ and $q = 37$ (such that $\\ord_p(q) = (p - 1)/2 = 105$), the sparsity equals the order. Why does this weak counterexample happen? Is there a larger primes $q$ with the same order, but with a stronger counterexample?\n",
    "        - Is such behaviour unique to $p = 13$ and $p = 211$ (these are the only two primes in the first 1000 primes with this behaviour), or are there larger primes $p$ with the same weird behaviour?\n",
    "    - For the primes that had a stronger counterexample for a larger field $\\FF_q$ (larger than the smallest possible $q$), was the next smallest $q$ the strongest counterexample? Is there another reason?\n",
